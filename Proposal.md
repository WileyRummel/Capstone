A restaurant review system for the pros. Get reviews from certified service industry veterans.  Anonymous service scoring keeps reviews honest; industry knowledge keeps them worthwhile. 

>As a food lover I want to get restaurant reviews that I know I can trust without having to search through bad reviews from people who don’t know what they’re talking about.

## Objectives & Tasks
Allow users to sign up.  After signing up, users must pass a simple quiz on their industry knowledge if they wish to comment.  If a user scores over 70% they pass, otherwise they are restricted from reviewing until they are able to pass the test.  After a quiz failure, users must wait 24 hours before testing again. 
Use Vomato API to create a restaurant database.  Show users default results based on current location(city,st or zip).
Allow certified users to add new restaurants that might not present.
Get users current location to generate default list to show on homepage and search results; can change search results based on user desired location.
